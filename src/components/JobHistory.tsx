                <h4>Senior Software Engineer</h4>
                <div className="work-company-role-duration">December 2020-Present</div>
                <p>I've worked on two teams during my time at Smartsheet. The Directory Services team and the Advanced Solutions team.</p>
                <p>
                    On the Directory Services team, I primarily worked on setting up a new decoupled microservice to store user data.
                    We built this Java/Spring service from scratch and it eventually was serving more than 4,000 requests per second.
                    During my time on this team, I also designed and led the implementation of the "Deactivate User" feature. Previously,
                    you could only delete users in Smartsheet which was a painful process on admins and an expensive computation to carry
                    out. My deactivate feature allows admins to block that user from logging in, improving the process for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Advanced Solutions team, I helped build and maintain the ability to group Smartsheet resources into collections.
                    These "Collections" allow you to group Sheets, Reports, or Dashboards located anywhere in Smartsheet and provides the
                    ability to share them to other users all at once. This makes it possible for admins to manage their sharing in a more
                    efficient manner and allows users to see everything they need in one spot. This work involved building a new service
                    from the ground up and designing a migration strategy to move data off a legacy code base.
